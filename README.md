# Lightning Time

‚ö°Ô∏è Lightning Time is a new way to measure time. It's a spin on hexadecimal time‚Äîthe day is split into 16 parts, then 16 again, and so on. A typical Lightning Time string looks like `8~e~f`, or `8~e~f|b`.

Because Lightning Time is hexadecimal time, it can also be used to represent time with three colors.

This extension allows you to play around with Lightning Time via converting to/from Lightning Time and getting Lightning Time colors.
